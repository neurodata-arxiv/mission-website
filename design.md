## related sites

1. http://www.braininitiative.org/
2. http://www.alleninstitute.org/ is close collaborators and closely related
3. https://www.janelia.org/ are also close collaborators and closely related

i don't particularly like 2 or 3, especially 3, but their institutional goals are closely related to ours

## orgnaization thoughts


for the website, i think it probably makes sense to essentially have THREE threads:

1. data
2. tools
3. experiments/applications/use cases/results

this is because "statistical science" is essentially a set of ideas,
not particularly useful for users in a certain sense.


## top of site

one of my favorite sites is:  http://jhu.edu is beautiful, especially the switching movies in the background.

i could see using the movies [here](videos.html) as background movies on the top.

then, as you scroll down, you get to

1. data
2. tools
3. applications/use cases/experiments



## data

each "data project" could have any of the following "functionalities":

(starred ones are there for *every* data project)

### ways to interact with data project that we support 
- *interactive exploration
- *share links/views of data
- extend experiments/results
- *download data products

### stuff to read
- *manuscript(s)
- media

### other stuff that one might want to with data that is harder

- lots of stuff, essentially, a subset of the tools are appropriate for for each data project (different subsets for different "kinds" of data projects).


### other info for every data project
- some beautiful images
- a 1-2 sentence description
- license info
- coauthors/contributors
- tags (which kinds of data are there, modalities, species, etc., to facilitate searching)

the "data project homepage" could have a list of boxes highlighting each of the different projects, that are "filterable" by clicking various tags.



## tools

each "tool project" could have any of the following functionalities/links:

(starred ones are there for *every* data project)


### ways to interact with tools
- read
	- *documentation
	- API
	- tutorials
	- manuscript
	- benchmarks
	- installation/setup guide
- *generate issues
- run (Web-apps available for some)

### other info for each tool project
- webpage for tool
- *source code
- *several "highlights" bullets
- an illustrative image
- *coauthors/contributors
- *tags (eg, which modality, data type, etc.)


tool projects could be organized much like the data projects, a bunch of boxes, filterable by clicking various tags.


## about/other


i feel like this one is just a footer with links to basic pages

## actions people might want to take on some data

not sure exactly what to do about these


- Data store for existing data
	- Look at some data?
	- Show some data to my labmates/colleages?
	- Download some data to play with on my computer?
- Data store functions for new data
	- Share my data?
	- Explore my data?
- Image analysis functions for your data
	- 2D color correct data
	- 3D color correct data
	- Multimodal register to atlas
	- Manually annotate some data
	- Train my machine vision algorithm on some data?
	- Run my machine vision algorithm at scale?
	- Assess the performance of my classifiers?
- various graph/matrix analysis things
- estimating graph from data
- ...
