3. https://www.janelia.org/ are also close collaborators and closely related

i don't particularly like them, but their institutional goals are closely related to ours

## site ideas

one of my favorite sites is:  http://jhu.edu is beautiful, especially the switching movies in the background.

i could see using the movies [here](videos.md) as background movies on the top.

then, as you scroll down, you get to

1. data
2. tools
3. applications/use cases/experiments

when scrolling down to data, i could image a couple things.

1. a matrix organized like http://neurodata.io/#browse, though with nicer pictures.  the downside of this is that it differentiates modalities,
2. an interactive graphic that looks something like this:
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v17/n11/images/nn.3839-F1.jpg
but each box/point would actually be clickable, and correspond to a particular dataset. the axes could be resolution and volume, or something like that.
3. a link to search, while highlighting certain projects, somewhat like http://www.missionmedia.com/case-studies
then, which projects got highlighted could change every few months or something, as we got new projects.
4. data could be organized in the same fashion as "tools", eg:
   1. images
   2. time-series
   3. shapes
   4.
